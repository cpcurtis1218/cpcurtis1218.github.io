Hi!  My name is Charles Curtis and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.  I currently have exprence using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Handlebars, React.js, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Express.js, and MongoDB.  To view my full resume and project, please visit my poortfolio using the link above.

I decided to become a Web Developer because I enjoy the process of problem solving in
creative ways.  Whether it's figuring out the best way to make that new feature work, or
learning the best technology to use for our project, the process of learning and growing
is a one that I've come to love.

If you'd like to learn more, or get in touch, please visit my porfolio for additional details.
